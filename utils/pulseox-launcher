# Launches the pulseox program

# I set a keyboard key to run this script, so family/caregivers/nurses
# can launch it easily.
#
# It'll kill a running version of itself if it finds any.
# *Note: It kills pretty much anything it finds with 'pulseox' in the
#        command line!

# To use:
# 1. Set po_bin= the path of your pulseox-bluetooth.py
# 2. Run this script, or map a shortcut to run it.
